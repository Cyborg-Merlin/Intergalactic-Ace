There are two ways I can handle the game's graphics
I can have simulated graphics, where the objects exist in a sort of imaginary space, and the game renders the objects on top of that space
I can have pixel perfect graphics, where the objects collide and interact if they touch in the game

I think I want to experiment with simulated graphics
Game pieces and other objects exist on a simulated grid of floating point numbers, then the game takes those floating point values and renders sprites and objects based extrapolated pixel coordinates
